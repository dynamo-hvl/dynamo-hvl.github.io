The Data-Driven Dynamics, Modeling and Control (DYNAMO) Laboratory at the [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/) focuses on the analysis, modeling, and control of mechatronic and robotic systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments. The lab’s work emphasizes a physics-informed and data-driven understanding of system behavior, combining mathematical modeling with experimental insight to support reliable decision-making in stochastic settings.

Research activities span mechatronic system design, system identification, nonlinear and stochastic dynamics, and control architectures for autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. The laboratory is open to and actively encourages collaboration in machine learning, artificial intelligence, system-level modeling, and discrete-event and decision-based modeling, particularly where these approaches complement physical modeling and real-world implementation. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, DYNAMO aims to develop robust, interpretable, and deployable solutions for modern control and robotic applications.
