    Robotics and data science are being explored as means to transform fruit and berry production into a smarter and more sustainable system. 
    Robot- and data-driven solutions are being developed and tested in real agricultural environments, with the aim that labor challenges may be reduced,
    productivity increased, and sustainability improved. Practical tools that can be trusted by farmers are intended to be created. 
    Through collaboration among growers, researchers, and technology partners, measurable, replicable, and future-ready production 
    systems for crops such as raspberries are being designed.

    Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of offshore wind farms are analyzed using a Discrete Event Simulation–based 
    optimization framework. Offshore wind systems are modeled as complex, uncertain environments where failures, 
    weather, logistics, and resources interact dynamically. By combining simulation with optimization, different
    maintenance and logistics strategies are evaluated to identify cost-effective solutions. The approach is 
    intended to reduce O&M costs, improve turbine availability, and support better decision-making for offshore
    wind farm planning and operations.
